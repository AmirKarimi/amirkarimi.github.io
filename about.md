My first computer was a .386 (12MHz) with 2MB of RAM and MS-DOS at 1994 when I was about 9 years old. Now I'm developing on an Ubuntu machine with an 8 Core i7 CPU (Totally about 11000MHz) and 8 GB of RAM.

My first experience of programming was building text animations using MS-DOS .BAT files. They were basically just consist of multiple echo commands and a cls for each frame. After a while I needed more advanced tool which led me to QBasic. I didn't have access to the Internet at the time and I just red about QBasic in a book. QBasic was a magic for me! I began to write many simple programs, such as simple games (at "SCREEN 13" mode), viruses (yes! computer virus) and some useful applications.

Finally, I found out that I'm a programmer! After one year of programming with Basic I got to know some other programming languages such as C, Pascal, VB, FoxPro, C++, Assembly, etc. After learning a little bit about each, I realized that I like C family languages.

My first real programming job which I was paid for was developing a standalone cutting optimization software in C++ (MFC). In 2003 I wrote my first web application in C# and .NET 2.0 and built my career on top of Microsoft platforms.

In Dec 2013 I decided to move to the wild and free world of the open source and completely moved my career to open source ecosystems as well as my day to day tools like the operating system, office, editors, IDE, etc.

Now my main stack is Scala, Play, Akka and I'm very proud of my decision.
