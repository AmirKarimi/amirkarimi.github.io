My first computer was a .386 (12MHz) with 2MB of RAM and MS-DOS in 1994 when I was about 9 years old.

My first experience of programming was building text animations using MS-DOS .BAT files. They basically just consisted of multiple echo commands followed by a cls for each frame. After a while, I felt that I need a more advanced tool which led me to QBasic. I didn't have access to the Internet at the time and I got to know about QBasic through a book. QBasic was a magic for me! I began to write many simple programs, such as simple games (at "SCREEN 13" mode + Some basic physics engines), viruses (yes! computer virus) and some useful applications.

After a year of programming with Basic, I got to know other programming languages such as C, Pascal, VB, FoxPro, C++, Assembly, etc. Learned a little bit about each, and I realized that I like the C family languages.

My first real programming job that I was paid for was developing a cutting optimization software in C++ (MFC). In 2003, I wrote my first web application in C# and .NET 2.0 and built my career on top of Microsoft platforms.

In Dec 2013, I decided to move to the wild and free world of the open source and completely moved my career to open source ecosystems as well as my day to day tools like the operating system, office, editors, IDE, etc. It was the best decision I've ever made in my career so far. I also chose Scala as my main programming language because I was looking for a similar language to C# but more open.

I've always worked as a contractor or a part-time employee. It gave me the chances to work with various technologies and platforms in different scales.

I left my home country and joined Cake Solutions at Manchester in Apr 2017.
