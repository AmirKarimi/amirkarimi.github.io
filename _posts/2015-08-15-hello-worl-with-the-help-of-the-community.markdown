I've always liked to have an international blog. I'm not very fluent in English and I'm afraid to share my experiences in English in the fear of making mistakes. 

Yeah! Writing the above block took me more than 10 minutes and obviously I couldn't get it done without Google!

One of the main reason that I could say no to my fear is the *community*. When I moved to the open source community (about one years ago) I found out how the communtiy brings people together to learn and improve their skills. I except the same behaviour about writing. I strongly believe that the community will help me improve my skills, even in writing.

As a result, this weblog is published on Github and your kind pull requests for correcting my mistakes are very very welcomed.

I'll add more information about myself, but for now, I'll let you know that I've been developing software for about 13 years and I think I was a geek even before that ;)
