Several month ago, I left Ubuntu for Arch. This is about my experiences and why I moved back to Ubuntu.

## Why moving to Arch ##

Arch is one of the most unopinionated distros available today. You're not forced (even recommended) to use a specific display manager, desktop environment, terminal, etc. while almost every choice is made available with good documentation and community support.

It encourages you to imporove your knowledge about Linux ecosystem, and find out how it works. Most importantly it helps you to be a part of the community.

## Arch experience ##

The learning experience started from the moment I began installing Arch. I just realized what happens behind the scenes of a graphical installation program.
